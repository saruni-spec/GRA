ToT - Ghana
In Ghana, "Turnover Tax" generally refers to components of the Modified
Taxation System (also known as Presumptive Tax Based on Turnover) for small
businesses and the Minimum Chargeable Income for larger companies
Modified Taxation Scheme
Simplified Tax Scheme for the Informal Sector
Effective July 1, 2025, the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) implemented a
simplified tax system for individuals earning income solely from business
activities within Ghana, primarily targeting the informal sector.
The Modified Taxation Scheme is a simple and flexible way for individuals
working in the informal sector to meet their tax obligations with the GRA. It
removes the complex processes of the standard tax system, making it easier to
comply.
This is not a new tax, but a redesigned approach to make filing and paying taxes
more practical for informal workers.
Who is this for? (The Informal Sector)
This scheme is for resident individuals who earn a living through their skills,
crafts, or sales without a formal corporate employment contract. This includes,
but is not limited to:
●​ Plumbers
●​ Electricians
●​ Hairdressers
●​ Seamstresses and Tailors
●​ Mechanics
●​ Air Conditioner Technicians
●​ Food Vendors, etc.
Categories of the Modified Taxation Scheme

There are three categories to suit different business sizes:
1. Presumptive Tax Based on Installment (PTI)
For whom: Businesses with average annual sales not exceeding GHC 20,000
over three consecutive years.
How it works: You pay a fixed tax amount based on your income level and type
of business activity.
2. Presumptive Tax Based on Turnover (PTT)
For whom: Businesses with annual sales of more than GHC 20,000 but not
exceeding GHC 500,000.
How it works: You pay a flat rate of 3% on your total annual sales (turnover).
3. Modified Cash Basis (MCB)
For whom: Taxpayers who do not qualify for the presumptive taxes (PTI and
PTT) or choose this method.
How it works: You pay tax only on your profit—your earnings after deducting
all allowable business expenses.
