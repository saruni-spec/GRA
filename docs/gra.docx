Technical Document 1 : GRA API Integration Architecture
1. Introduction
This document defines how we will integrate the Proof of Concept (PoC) with the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) Core Domestic Tax Administration System (CDTAS) using secure, modular, and standards-aligned APIs.
The integration supports:
Registration


Identity validation


MTS tax computation


Filing submission


Business identification insights


Officer dashboards


This architecture ensures:
No disruption to GRA production systems


Full compliance with data governance laws


Secure one-way or mocked data flows for PoC


2. Integration Goals
Enable informal-sector users to self-register via WhatsApp/USSD.


Use Ghana Card (NIA) data for taxpayer identity verification.


Fetch existing taxpayer records where permitted.


Submit pre-filled tax returns to a sandbox CDTAS endpoint.


Provide GRA officers with real-time PoC dashboard access.


Maintain secure, auditable API calls with full traceability.


3. Integration Principles
Principle
Description
Security-first
Encryption (TLS 1.3), OAuth2.0 client credentials, strict RBAC
Non-intrusive
PoC integrates into sandbox; production systems remain untouched
Modular
Each function (registration, filing, identification) is a separate API component
Interoperable
Aligns with GovStack Information Mediator building block
Low-tech compatible
Designed to support WhatsApp, USSD, SMS, and WhatsApp Voice

       |
       +-- Officer Dashboard → GRA Web Interface (Secure Portal)


5. API Components
5.1 Identity Verification API (NIA Ghana Card Lookup)
Purpose: Validate user identity using Ghana Card details.
Inputs:
Ghana Card number


Full name


Date of birth and/or


Mobile number


Outputs:
Identity match score


Valid/invalid status


Optional demographic data (where permitted)


Security:
OAuth2.0

5.2 Taxpayer Registry API 
Purpose: Determine whether a user is already registered as a taxpayer.
Inputs:
Ghana Card number


Phone number


Name


Outputs:
TIN (if exists)


Taxpayer type


Historical filing status


MTS eligibility


Usage in PoC:
Pre-fills registration


Avoids duplicate taxpayers


5.3 Tax Filing Submission API
Purpose: Submit PoC MTS filings to CDTAS sandbox.
Inputs:
TIN


Tax period


Turnover


Applicable tax (fixed levy or 3%)


Filing metadata (channel, time, payment reference)


Outputs:
Filing confirmation ID


Tax status (submitted/accepted/rejected or as per GRA appropriate status)



Logic:
PoC will use sandbox returns, no impact on production.


5.4 Mock Payment Integration API
Purpose: Simulate MoMo/ Mobile payments.
Inputs:
Payer mobile

4. Data Sources & What They Provide
Data Source
Data Provided
Contribution to Identification
NIA – Ghana Card
Name, DOB, ID, contact
Primary identity verification
ORC – Registrar of Companies
Business names, owners, contacts
Detects informal operators running registered entities without tax registration
DVLA
Vehicle ownership, licensing
Identifies mobile traders
Municipal Councils

5. Integration Methods
For the PoC, each dataset can be integrated through one of these strategies:
5.1 API-Based Integration 
When sandbox APIs are available, use REST APIs secured via:
OAuth2.0


IP whitelisting


TLS 1.3


Example (NIA Ghana Card Verification API)
POST /api/nia/verifyIdentity
{
  "ghanaCardNumber": "GHA-123456789-1",
  "fullName": "Ama Yeboah",
  "dob": "1986-02-01"
}

Response:
{
  "match": true,
  "confidence": 0.98,
  "registeredPhone": "0244XXXXXX"
}


5.2 Batch CSV/JSON Uploads (Fallback)
When APIs are unavailable, a secure batch upload of test data is provided.
Sources: ORC, SSNIT, DVLA, Lands.
5.3 Federated Search (Documentation-Only Mode)
If no sandbox or samples exist, the PoC demonstrates:
API design


expected response schemas


mock data


simulated matching


This is acceptable for early-stage PoC.
6. Data Matching Logic (Fusion Engine)
The fusion engine merges multi-source data using identity resolution.
6.1 Primary Matching Keys
Ghana Card Number


Phone Number


Name + DOB combination


6.2 Secondary Matching Keys

Technical Document 3 — Osint & Social Media Identification Methodology
1. Introduction
This section outlines the proposed approach for identifying 20–30 informal-sector businesses in Ghana using publicly available data sources, WhatsApp verification, and basic pattern recognition algorithms.
Core Principle: Use only public data + WhatsApp-based validation to build a business database that feeds the officer dashboard.

2. What is OSINT for Tax Identification?
OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence) = gathering business information from publicly accessible sources without breaching privacy laws.
For informal businesses in Ghana, OSINT sources include:
Google Maps business listings
Facebook Marketplace sellers
Public business directories (Tonaton, Jiji, YellowPages Ghana)
WhatsApp Business API verified accounts
Municipal market trader lists (where publicly available

5. Phone Number Extraction & Validation
Step 1: Use regex patterns to extract Ghana phone numbers:
Format: 0XX XXXX XXX or +233 XX XXX XXXX
Example: 0244 123 456 or +233 24 412 3456
Step 2: Validate via:
Ghana telecom number ranges (MTN: 024/054/055, Vodafone: 020/050, AirtelTigo: 027/057)
Remove duplicates
Check against existing GRA database
Step 3: WhatsApp verification:
Send Message:
"Ghana Revenue Authority is identifying informal businesses 
for simplified tax registration. Reply YES if you operate 
a business. This is confidential. Reply STOP to opt out."

Response = Valid Business
No Response = Flag as "Unconfirmed"

6. Business Type Classification (Simple Keyword Matching)
We use keyword-based classification (not complex AI):
Keywords Found
Business Type
"hair", "salon", "beauty"
Hairdressing/Beauty
"food", "chop bar", "restaurant"
Food Services
"tailor", "sewing", "fashion"
Tailoring
"phone", "repair", "electronics"
Electronics Repair
"transport", "taxi", "driver"
Transport Services
"shop", "provisions", "store"
Retail

Accuracy Target: 80%+ (validated manually during PoC)
7. Confidence Scoring
Each identified business gets a confidence score:
Confidence Score Formula:
= (Data Source Weight) + (WhatsApp Response Weight) + (Phone Validity Weight)

Example:
- Google Maps listing: +40%
- WhatsApp reply: +30%
- Valid Ghana phone: +20%
- Location GPS match: +10%

Total: 100% = High Confidence

Thresholds:
80%+ → Auto-approve for officer review
60-79% → Flag for manual verification
Below 60% → Exclude from PoC dataset


8. Privacy & Legal Compliance
Legal Safeguards:
Only public data sources
No hacking or unauthorized access
No scraping of private social media profiles
WhatsApp opt-out mechanism ("Reply STOP")
Ghana Data Protection Act compliant
Data deleted after PoC unless user registers
What We DON'T Do:
No facial recognition
No tracking of personal movements
No scraping of private messages
No unauthorized data sales
9. WhatsApp Integration for OSINT
WhatsApp serves as the verification layer:
OSINT Engine identifies phone number
         ↓
Send WhatsApp verification message
         ↓
User replies YES → Mark as "Confirmed Business"
         ↓
Invite to register for MTS tax via WhatsApp flow

This creates a seamless transition from identification → registration → filing, all within WhatsApp.
10. Implementation Timeline (6 Weeks)

{
  "businessId": "BIZ-001",
  "name": "Ama's Beauty Salon",
  "phone": "0244123456",
  "businessType": "Hairdressing",
  "location": "Madina Market",
  "gps": {"lat": 5.6837, "lng": -0.1965},
  "confidence": 0.87,
  "source": "Google Maps + WhatsApp Verified",
  "status": "Ready for Officer Review"
}

12. Risks & Mitigations
Risk
Mitigation
Outdated phone numbers
WhatsApp verification filters invalid contacts
Duplicate listings
De-duplication algorithm by phone + name
Privacy complaints
Clear opt-out mechanism + legal compliance
Low WhatsApp response rate
Follow-up via SMS or USSD
Inaccurate business types
Manual officer review before onboarding




13. Conclusion
This OSINT methodology enables GRA to:
Discover informal businesses using public data
Verify them via WhatsApp with minimal cost
Classify them automatically for targeted outreach
Scale the approach to thousands of businesses post-PoC
Key Advantage: WhatsApp verification creates a zero-friction path from identification to registration, all within a single familiar platform.





 Technical Document #4 — Geospatial Mapping System
1. Introduction
Informal businesses in Ghana rarely have fixed addresses. This system uses GPS coordinates, market clustering, and WhatsApp location sharing to map where businesses operate, enabling GRA officers to visualize taxpayer distribution and plan field operations.

    └──────────────────┘

3. Location Data Collection Methods
Method 1: WhatsApp Location Sharing (Primary)
Users share their business location directly via WhatsApp:
WhatsApp Flow:
GRA: "Please share your business location"
[User taps "Send Location" button]
System receives: {lat: 5.6837, lng: -0.1965}
System geocodes: "Madina Market, Accra"

Advantages:
Native WhatsApp feature (no training needed)
Accurate GPS coordinates
Works on all smartphones
User-controlled privacy
Method 2: OSINT GPS Extraction (Secondary)
Extract coordinates from:
Google Maps listings
Facebook Marketplace location tags
Geotagged business photos
Method 3: Market Boundary Polygons (Backup)
For users without smartphones, assign to nearest known market:
Market Name
GPS Coordinates
Approx. Traders
Makola Market
5.6037, -0.1870
10,000+
Madina Market
5.6837, -0.1965
5,000+
Kaneshie Market
5.5553, -0.2372
8,000+
Kumasi Central Market
6.6885, -1.6244
12,000+


4. Clustering Algorithm (Market Hotspot Detection)
We use DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering):
Input: List of GPS coordinates
Output: Market clusters

Algorithm:
1. Find all businesses within 500m radius
2. If ≥10 businesses found → Create cluster
3. Label as "Market Hotspot"
4. Assign cluster ID

Example Output:
Cluster_001: Madina Market (127 businesses)
Cluster_002: Dome Market (89 businesses)
Cluster_003: Achimota Market (56 businesses)

Visual Representation:
       Madina Market
    ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
  ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●    <- Dense cluster = Market
  ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●
    ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ● ●

        Scattered Traders
  ●           ●
         ●          ●         <- Low density = Mobile/Home-based
    ●        ●

5. OpenStreetMap Integration
Why OpenStreetMap?
Free and open-source
Excellent Ghana coverage
Works offline (cached tiles)
No API fees
Implementation:
Use Leaflet.js for interactive maps
Cache map tiles for low-bandwidth areas
Overlay business markers on map
Color-code by: business type, tax status, verification level

6. Officer Dashboard Map Features

7. Heatmap Generation
Purpose: Show where informal economic activity is concentrated.
Methodology:
Count businesses per 1km² grid square
Color intensity = density
Update in real-time as new businesses identified
Sample Output:
Accra Region Business Density Heatmap:

     LOW                          HIGH
     ░░░░░░░░▒▒▒▒▒▒▓▓▓▓▓▓████████

Darkest areas = Highest concentration
= Priority areas for GRA outreach

8. Mobile Trader Tracking (Future Enhancement)
For mobile traders (e.g., food vendors, delivery drivers):
Track multiple location check-ins over time
Identify regular routes
Map "mobile market corridors"
PoC Limitation: Static locations only for initial version.
9. Offline Functionality
Challenge: Many areas have poor internet connectivity.
Solution:
Pre-cache OpenStreetMap tiles for all 16 Ghana regions
Store GPS coordinates locally
Sync to server when connection available
Officers can view maps offline

10. Implementation Timeline

3. Component 1: Voice-to-Text Engine
Purpose: Convert WhatsApp voice notes to text for bookkeeping.
Technology: Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
Why not build from scratch?
World-class accuracy (95%+)
Supports Twi + English
Low latency (<2 seconds)
Cost-effective for PoC

Workflow:
User sends WhatsApp voice note:
"I sold three bags of rice for two hundred and fifty cedis"
        ↓
Google Speech-to-Text API
        ↓
Text output: "I sold three bags of rice for 250 cedis"
        ↓
Transaction Categorizer (Component 2)

Implementation:
// Pseudo-code
async function processVoiceNote(audioFile) {
  const text = await googleSpeechAPI.recognize(audioFile, {
    language: 'en-GH', // Ghana English
    alternativeLanguages: ['tw-GH'] // Twi support
  });
  return text;
}

4. Component 2: Transaction Categorization Engine
Purpose: Automatically classify income/expense from text messages.

Rule-Based Logic
User Message
Detected Pattern
Classification
Amount
Category
"Sold 3 bags of rice for 250 cedis"
"sold" + amount
INCOME
250
Sales
"Bought supplies 100 cedis"
"bought" + amount
EXPENSE
100
Supplies
"Paid rent 500"
"paid rent" + amount
EXPENSE
500
Rent
"Customer paid 75 cedis"
"paid" (to me) + amount
INCOME
75
Sales



Keyword Dictionary:
Income Keywords:
- sold, sale, customer paid, received, earned, income

Expense Keywords:
- bought, purchased, paid, spent, cost, expense

Amount Detection:
- Regex pattern: \d+\s*(cedis|GHS|GH₵)
- Number words: "fifty" → 50, "hundred" → 100

Implementation (Simplified):
def categorize_transaction(text):
    # Extract amount
    amount = extract_amount(text)  # regex + number parsing
    
    # Detect type
    if any(word in text.lower() for word in ['sold', 'received', 'earned']):
        type = 'INCOME'
    elif any(word in text.lower() for word in ['bought', 'paid', 'spent']):
        type = 'EXPENSE'
    else:
        type = 'UNKNOWN'  # Ask user for clarification
    
    # Detect category
    category = detect_category(text)  # keyword matching
    
    return {
        'amount': amount,
        'type': type,
        'category': category,
        'confidence': calculate_confidence(text)
    }

Confidence Scoring:
Clear keywords + amount = 95%+ confidence
Missing amount = ask user to clarify
Ambiguous keywords = request confirmation via WhatsApp

5. Component 3: Business Type Classifier
Purpose: Automatically classify business type from OSINT data or user description.
Approach: Keyword matching (same as Document #3)
Categories:
Retail (shop, store, provisions)
Food Services (chop bar, restaurant, food vendor)
Hairdressing/Beauty (salon, barber, beauty)
Tailoring (sewing, fashion, tailor)
Transport (taxi, driver, delivery)
Repairs (phone repair, electrician, plumber)
Other
Example:
Input: "I run a small chop bar near Madina Market"
Keywords detected: "chop bar"
Output: Business Type = Food Services
Confidence: 92%

6. Training Data Strategy
Challenge: No existing labeled dataset for Ghanaian informal bookkeeping.
Solution: Synthetic data generation + pilot user data
Synthetic Data Examples:
[
  {"text": "Sold 5 bags of rice for 250 cedis", "type": "INCOME", "amount": 250, "category": "Sales"},

8. Why NOT Deep Learning for PoC?
Reasons to avoid complex ML:
Time constraint: 6-8 weeks insufficient for model training
Data scarcity: No large labeled dataset available
Interpretability: Rule-based systems easier to debug
Resource efficiency: Lower compute costs
Accuracy: Rule-based can achieve 95%+ for structured tasks
Future Enhancement:
Phase 2 could incorporate neural networks for:
Handwriting recognition (receipts)
Complex sentence parsing
Predictive tax compliance scoring
9. Implementation Timeline
Week
Activity
1-2
Google Speech-to-Text API integration + testing
2-3
Transaction categorization rule engine
3-4
Business classifier keyword system
4-5
Synthetic training data generation (200+ examples)
5-6
End-to-end testing with pilot users


10. Error Handling & User Feedback
When model is uncertain:
WhatsApp Flow:
User: "Spent some money on supplies"

System: "I detected an expense but couldn't determine 
the amount. Please reply with the amount spent."

User: "120 cedis"

System: "✅ Recorded: Expense - Supplies - 120 GHS"

This creates a human-in-the-loop system that maintains high accuracy even when models are unsure.
11. Privacy & Security
✅ Voice notes are NOT stored after transcription
 ✅ Text data encrypted in transit and at rest
 ✅ No third-party data sharing beyond Google API
 ✅ User can delete all data anytime via WhatsApp command
12. Conclusion
This ML system enables:
Effortless bookkeeping via voice or text
95%+ automation of transaction categorization
Minimal user training required
Scalable architecture for nationwide rollout
By using proven APIs + simple rules instead of custom deep learning, we deliver:
Faster development
Higher reliability
Lower costs
Easier maintenance

Technical Document #8 — Multi-Channel Strategy
1. Introduction
Ghana’s informal sector spans a wide digital spectrum, requiring a solution that adapts to diverse user behaviors and technology environments:

Many taxpayers prefer WhatsApp due to its familiar, data-lite interface and the fact that it requires no additional app installation.

Others rely heavily on USSD, particularly users with low literacy, limited data access, or basic feature phones.

There is a a portion responds best to SMS reminders, which reach users in all regions and on all device types.

Low-literacy and rural users often prefer voice-based interaction, best delivered through WhatsApp Business API Voice, which replaces traditional IVR with a more intuitive, accessible experience.

A national-scale tax digitization system must therefore operate seamlessly across all major communication channels, ensuring that taxpayers are not forced into a single digital pathway.

This document outlines:
Channel roles


Architecture across multiple channels


User flow consistency


Continuity & fallback logic


Redundancy & failover design


Multi-channel identity linking


Analytics per channel

“Yɛma wo akwaaba! Bra yɛn boa wo hyɛ wo adwuma ho kwan ma ɛnyɛ wo den.”
Example (Ga):
“Oyaa, yɛɛkɛ. Taflatse, yɛgbɛ hewalɛ mli lɛ eba wo shishimɔ.”
Example (Ewe):
“Woezɔ! Miawoe nà kplɔ mia ƒe bizinesi dzidzedzekpɔ kpɔkpɔ.”
5.2 USSD Localization
USSD requires:
short sentences


numeric menus


simple instruction


low literacy vocabulary


Example (USSD menu in Twi):
1. Kyerɛ wo sika a wo nya
2. Kyerɛ wo sika a wo de gyaa
3. Fa file tax
4. Hwehwɛ wo status

No long text


No tax jargon


Max 1–2 sentences per screen



5.3 SMS Localization
SMS focuses on:
reminders


educational nudges


filing deadlines


Example (Ewe):
“Mia filing ƒe deadline le Friday. Taflatse, do go via WhatsApp.”

5.4 WhatsApp Voice Localization
Whatsapp voice is critical for low-literacy users.
Voice content recorded by:
native speakers


in warm, friendly tone


slow cadence


repetition allowed


Example Flow (Twi):
“Press 1 sɛ wopɛ sɛ wo register. Press 2 sɛ wobɛ file tax.”

6. Cultural Communication Principles
1. Use Familiar Everyday Language
Avoid: “Submit your bookkeeping entries.”
 Use: “Bɔ wo sika ho amanneɛ ha.”
2. Use Warm, Respectful Tone
Ghanians respond positively to polite, supportive language.
3. Avoid Threatening Tax Language
Never imply punishment during onboarding.

“Try filing now” works better than “File now”.
7. Localized Bookkeeping Flows
Twi Example:
“Ɛnnɛ, wopɛ sɛ wɔtɔ wo adwuma mu sika? Bɔ wo ‘income’ ha.”
Ga Example:
“Shiɛ lɛ, shwie wo gbɛkɛ nɛɛ ebaa lɛ hete?”
Ewe Example:
“Neɖe edzi be nà ɖo dzidzedzekpɔ? Wokpɔ ameha dzidzɔ me.”

8. Localized Filing Flows
English:
“Your tax for this month is 15 GHS.”
Twi:
“Wo sika a ɛsɛ sɛ woka saa bosome yi mu ne 15 cedis.”
Ga:
“GHS 15 lɛ nɔni lɛ yɛwɔ ke nyɛ.”
Ewe:
“GHS 15 nye nu si nàɖo kpli mia tax ƒe xexea me.”
9. Visual Localization for WhatsApp

Only purpose-aligned and minimal data is stored.
5. Lawful Basis for Processing
Processing is done under:
Legitimate Interest of GRA to administer taxes


Consent for optional uploads/OSINT inputs


Public Interest in national revenue collection


Contractual obligation between GRA and service provider


Nothing is done beyond taxation purposes.
6. Purpose Limitation
Collected data is used exclusively for:
taxpayer identification


onboarding


bookkeeping


tax computation & filing


fraud reduction


compliance monitoring


performance analytics


improving system accuracy


No data is used for:
surveillance


political profiling


commercial targeting


non-tax purposes


7. Data Processing Lifecycle
Collect → Validate → Transform → Use → Store → Audit → Archive/Delete

Collection
minimal input


transparency notices


multi-channel consent (WhatsApp/USSD/IVR)


Use
only for PoC workflows


AI models use anonymized or pseudonymized data where possible


Storage
encrypted Postgres DB


encrypted object storage


strict access control


Deletion
data automatically deleted after PoC or according to GRA policy


8. Data Flow Architecture
WhatsApp/USSD → API Gateway → Encryption → Processing Services → DB → Analytics → Dashboards

Encrypt at:
Channel Layer (WhatsApp is end-to-end encrypted)


Transport Layer (TLS 1.3)


Data Layer (AES-256)


Key Management (KMS, role-specific keys)

9. Data Minimization Controls
Only store what is required for tax assessment.


Contact cards / images optional, not mandatory.


No raw audio stored — only text transcripts when needed.


OSINT (flyers, images) stored only temporarily during classification (14-day retention).


Location pins stored only at market-level granularity, not residential.

11. Access Control Policy
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Role
Access Level
GRA Officer
Taxpayer profiles, filings
GRA Supervisor
Analytics + override authority
Chat Nation Support
Technical logs (no taxpayer data)
Data Scientist
Anonymized datasets only
ML Engineer
Model training, no identity data
System Admin
Infrastructure only, no content

All access is:
authenticated (OAuth2 / IAM)


logged


monitored


time-boxed (temporary credentials)


12. Encryption Standards
In Transit
TLS 1.2/1.3


WhatsApp end-to-end encryption


Mutual TLS for sensitive services




At Rest
AES-256 on DB


SSE-S3/SSE-Blob with KMS keys


Redis encrypted with TLS


In Use (ML)
Sensitive fields masked


Optional confidential computing enclave (Azure/GCP)


13. AI/ML Governance
A. Model Explainability
Tax calculations explainable step-by-step.
B. Fairness
No discrimination by:
gender


ethnicity


region


language


economic status


C. OSINT Governance
Rules:
OSINT is assisted by user uploads, not scraping users’ private data


No surveillance


Only public & user-shared materials used


Models trained on anonymized data


D. Bias Testing
Before deployment:
demographic fairness tests


regional variance analysis


E. ML Auditability
Full logs of:
predictions


confidence levels


overrides


corrections


14. Privacy-by-Design Controls
