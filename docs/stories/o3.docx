# OSINT & Social Media Identification: An Explainer

This document outlines the approach we will use to **find and verify 20–30 informal businesses in Ghana** to help with simplified tax registration, using a four-step process.

-----

## 1\. System Goal (The Big Picture)

**Our Goal is simple:** To automatically identify informal businesses using public data and then verify them directly through WhatsApp.

  * **We will do:** Use a blend of open-source data and simple automated tools.
  * **We will get:** A clean database of businesses with a high Confidence Score that is ready for an officer to review.
  * **Because of:** This approach is low-cost, scalable, and respects privacy, using the familiar WhatsApp platform to get confirmation directly from the business owners.

## 2\. Step 1: Discovering Potential Businesses (OSINT)

This step is about gathering raw data from the public domain.

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Scrape public web sources** including Google Maps listings, Facebook Marketplace sellers, and Ghanaian directories like Tonaton and Jiji. | **Raw Data** for business name, phone number, GPS coordinates, and category keywords. | This process is called **Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT)**: it uses data that is publicly accessible, ensuring we comply with all privacy laws. |
| We will also check any available **Municipal market trader lists**.                                                                         | **High-Accuracy Data** from official sources.                                         | This acts as a reliable seed data source to ensure we find businesses in key market areas.                                                       |

## 3\. Step 2: Cleaning the Data and Phone Validation

Before we contact anyone, we must ensure the phone numbers are valid and unique.

| :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Use **regular expressions (regex)** and **Ghana telecom number ranges** (e.g., MTN: 024/054/055) on the raw phone numbers. | **Clean, Valid Phone Numbers** in a standard international format. | This filters out wrong, outdated, or poorly formatted numbers, which reduces wasted effort in the next step and improves overall data quality. |
| Run the valid numbers through a **de-duplication algorithm**.                                                              | A list of **Unique Business Contacts**.                            | This prevents us from sending multiple, confusing messages to the same business listed on different platforms (like Google Maps and Facebook). |

## 4\. Step 3: Business Verification (The WhatsApp Loop)

WhatsApp is the most critical step as it turns a *potential* business into a *confirmed* business.

| What We Will Do (X)                                                                                                                                   | What We Will Get (Y)                                                          | Why We Do It (Z)                                                                                                                              |
| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Send a templated WhatsApp message** (via the WhatsApp Business API) asking the business owner to reply **YES** to confirm their business operation. | A **Confirmed Business** status and a **+30% bonus** to the Confidence Score. | The business owner confirms their active status, transforming a low-confidence OSINT lead into a high-confidence, verified taxpayer prospect. |
| The message will include a **Reply STOP** option.                                                                                                     | **Legal Compliance** with the Ghana Data Protection Act and a clear opt-out.  | This ensures that our process is ethical and legally sound, preventing privacy complaints from users who don't want to participate.           |
| Upon a "YES" reply, the system automatically invites the user to **register for MTS tax** via a WhatsApp flow.                                        | A **Seamless Transition** from identification to registration.                | This makes the path to tax compliance zero-friction, as the user remains within the single, familiar WhatsApp platform.                       |

## 5\. Step 4: Scoring and Approval

This step automates the decision of which businesses an officer should spend time on.

| :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Calculate a Confidence Score** using a weighted formula: **(Data Source Weight) + (WhatsApp Response Weight) + (Phone Validity Weight)**. *(E.g., Google Maps is +40%, WhatsApp reply is +30%, valid phone is +20%).* | A single number, from 0 to 100%, that represents our certainty the contact is a real, active business. | This allows us to automate the vetting process and prioritize the best leads for our officers.                                                                                                               |
| **Apply threshold rules** to the score.                                                                                                                                                                                 | **Automated Status Tags:** Auto-approve (80%+), Manual Verification (60–79%), or Exclude (\<60%).      | We only want officers spending time on businesses that are highly likely to be legitimate, ensuring we hit our target of identifying **20-30 businesses with ≥80% accuracy** for the Proof-of-Concept (PoC). |
| **Classify the business type** using a simple **keyword matching** system on the name and category data (e.g., "chop bar" = Food Services).                                                                             | An automated Business Type classification (e.g., Hairdressing/Beauty, Retail, Transport Services).     | This enables targeted outreach campaigns and planning for our officers.                                                                                                                                      |

## 6\. Implementation and Assurance

  * **Timeline:** The entire Proof-of-Concept (PoC) is planned for **6 weeks**, from setting up web scrapers (Week 1) to integrating the final data feed into the Officer Dashboard (Week 6).
  * **Privacy:** We only use **public data** and **do not** use facial recognition, track personal movements, or scrape private messages. Voice notes are immediately deleted after transcription to protect user data.
